### Accessibility
Several menu-related elements are assigned a label using the [aria-label](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Aria-Labels) attribute: **ariaRegion**, **menuItem**, and **menuEnd**. These labels are not visible elements. They are utilized by assistive technology such as screen readers. Should the label texts need to be customised, they can be found within the **globals** object in [*properties.schema*](https://github.com/deltanet/adapt-contrib-deltaboxmenu/blob/master/properties.schema).
